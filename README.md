# Projective-Curve-Viewer
A program for viewing real projective algebraic planar curves. Allows for smooth and intuitive change of affine chart in use.

The code is written in C++ with Qt Creator except for a couple of OpenGL shaders. Known to compile and run on Windows and Linux systems.
Mac should work as well.

To build and run:
1.) Open the project in Qt Creator (I use version 5.7.0).
2.) Build.
3.) Copy the vertex shader and fragment shader programs to the directory where the output .exe file is located.
    (For me, this is one directory up, then in "build-Projective Curve Viewer-Desktop_Qt_5_7_0_MinGW_32bit-Release/release")
4.) Run the program.

There is a brief set of instructions under the "Help" menu.
